# PocketAdmin
An Android application intended to handle the administration of MySQL on the go. It has features similar to PhpMyAdmin, and used JDBC for direct connectivity to MySQL. 

Note: this was done as a proof of concept project. MySQL databases should never be exposed to the public. CRUD operations should be performed through a backend (e.g. REST API) with proper authentication and authorization techniques.
